# Module 4- Web APIs: Code Quiz

## The Task

### We had to build a timed coding quiz with multiple choice questions. The app will run in the browser and features HTMl, CSS, and Javascript code. 

# The features of the application include:
- A timer that starts when presented with the questions.
- Every incorrect answer will reduce the time by 10 seconds.
- When all the questions are answered or if the timer reaches 0 then the game is over. 
- Lastly, the ability to save initials and score.

## Mock-Up:

The following picture demonstrates the application functionality:
